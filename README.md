# sentiment-analysis

This project is intended to perform sentiment analysis on the english corpus of the IITB english-hindi translation corpus.<br/>

Following steps have been implemented for this purpose<br/>
<ul>
<li>Preprocess the data - This includes removal of stopwords etc.</li>
<li>Build the LSTM model</li>
<li>Train the LSTM model - for this purpose, we have used the labelled data in the training_data.csv file as the corpus itself does not have the sentiments associated with each sentence</li>
<li>Perform the sentiment analysis on the english corpus</li>
</ul>
